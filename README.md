### What Is RFID Access Control?

Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) utilises electromagnetic fields to automatically identify and track various objects.
Most RFID systems include a microchip with an antenna (tag), a reader with an antenna and an access control server.
An RFID system cross-references the data stored on the tag with its own database. If it matches, the access is then granted.

Used module: High Frequency 13.56 MHz and higher (HF) 


### How Does RFID Access Control Work?

As mentioned above, an RFID access control system usually consists of a tag, a reader with an antenna and an access control server.
The card reader is constantly emitting a radio frequency energy field. 
Therefore, when the card enters the field, the power from the RF field energises an aerial of copper wire inside the card. 
The wire is connected to the smart card chip inside the card.
The aerial powers the chip containing ID number and any other data contained on the card, such as unique customer or facility code. 
This ID number is then sent back to the reader.
